# sdkgen-validate — agent guide

## Temporary local tool development

Prefer local symlinks to sibling tool checkouts when developing or testing
unreleased Voxgig tools together. Link to the actual package root (for example,
`apidef/ts` or `sdkgen/ts`), build that checkout, and verify that the consumer
resolves the linked code. Use existing validator local-path options where
available.

Do not create or copy `.zip`, `.tgz`, or `npm pack` snapshots into SDK projects
or ad hoc `vendor/` folders just to use local changes. Keep temporary links in
ignored dependency directories; keep machine-specific paths and temporary
`file:` dependencies out of committed manifests and lockfiles. Shared builds
and CI should use published versions or explicitly check out and build the
required source revisions.

Archives are appropriate when testing package contents or installation from a
packed release. Put those artifacts in a temporary test directory and clean
up artifacts created by the test afterward; do not scatter them across repos.


## Source code comments

Follow [COMMENT-POLICY.md](COMMENT-POLICY.md): comments are sparse and terse,
only for intricate or surprising code. Names carry intent; documents carry
requirements. Run `make comments comments-test` after editing source.
